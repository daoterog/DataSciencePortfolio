# Project Portfolio
This repository is created in order to demonstrate skill sets, knowledge, and what I find interesting.
A collection of data science projects, functions, pipelines, and rutines I usually use.

# Contents
- SDW_Image_Classification: The first stage of the project focusses on building a classifier that uses machine learning algorithms and image processinf techniques. A satistfactory performance was achieved by implementing the Bag of Feature technique, along a manually construed object centering method. The research paper documentating the used techniques and experimentation results may be found there.
- Heuristics: In here I reference some of the algorithms I developed to solve the Set Covering Problem. You may find Variable Neighborhood Search and Hybrid Genetic Algorithms.
