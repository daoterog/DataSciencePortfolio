# Solid Domestic Waste Image Classification

This compiles the work that I have performed for my Research Practice I. In here you can find the final versions of the python notebooks that I used to experiment and showcase my work in presentations.

# Contents
- demo_notebook.ipynb: I suggest you to check out this one first. It focusses on the image processing pipeline, it explains the functions and showcases the process that an image goes through before being passed to a certain model.
- experimentation.ipynb: It focusses on the evaluation pipeline that I designed in order to compile the experiments performed over several models and datasets.
- data: contains two zip folders that contain the images. If you wish to replicate my work feel free to donwload them.
